Our narrative case studies will range from bronze age societal studies to cutting edge computing and Internet technologies, and throughout the semester we will compare and contrast these narratives in search of larger trends.  We will also identify and investigate broader issues such as large technological systems; paradigms and scientific revolutions; technologies and political values; ethical theories; and the environmental and sustainability implications of technologies.  Throughout the semester we will engage these narratives and broader issues through targeted writing activities, debates, individual and group presentations, at least one field trip, movie and media studies, and numerous in-class discussions.

As composers and performers, students concentrate on instruments, voices, and the symbolic language that brings them to life. They compose music for every family of instruments (woodwinds,brass, strings, percussion), as well as voice and spoken word. The course features biweekly performances of original compositions. Students also have the opportunity to hear their works performed in concert settings by professional and peer musicians with whom they have collaborated. Seminar trips to Boston and New York enable the class to gather musical and inspirational material,in addition to hearing some of the finest orchestral and vocal ensembles in concert.

In this project-based course, students will have opportunities for hands-on learning in audio recording and editing, photography and printing, and video recording and editing. Science and engineering content are integrated in order to provide a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the devices we use to gather sound and images and in order to understand more fully the properties of seeing and hearing. A major goal is to enlarge our awareness of the environment we inhabit and to respond to the perceived environment by producing original visual and sonic artwork. Students will complete projects including a self-portrait, a sound-piece that is used as an audio track for a short video, a video documentary, and a staged narrative. Our process is to share work through discussion sessions as we follow projects from their initial stages to completion and final presentation. Additional context for Seeing and Hearing is provided by selected readings, visits by guest lecturers, additional faculty and staff participation and by viewing work of other professional practitioners.

AHSE1155,"Adler, Jonathan",4 AHSE,"Perhaps the most fundamental question any developing individual asks himself/herself is: who am I? The ways we answer this question have evolved over the course of history as the dominant ways of knowing (epistemologies) have shifted. Indeed, the question of how we come to know ourselves has captivated Western scholars since the days of Descartes, but a look at the last fifty to sixty years has also seen enormous changes. Many people invoke psychological and philosophical perspectives in describing their identity, focusing on their personality, their developmental history, and their place in society. But the explosion of neurobiological research has introduced a new and viable outlook: explaining identity at the chemical and electrical level of the brain. There is good reason to think that these different perspectives on identity are mutually exclusive and this tension will underlie everything we discuss in this interdisciplinary course. Indeed, when it comes to a topic as fundamental to human existence as identity, it is absolutely essential to wonder not only ""who am I?"" but to also ask ""how do I know?"" In this course, we will approach the question of identity from multiple perspectives, including psychology, postmodern philosophy, and neuroscience. In the process, we will critically examine not only the conception of identity that each perspective supports, but also the assumptions and limitations of each epistemology.

o What do anthropologists mean by culture?
o What does it mean to take cultural difference seriously?
o Does culture have an influence on what is considered legitimate ""knowledge""?
o If knowledge is ""situated,"" what happens when one form of knowledge comes in contact with another (for instance in discussions of global human rights)?

SP16:  AHSE2199:  Chemistry in Context:  Environmental Milestones, Opportunities and the Human Connection; 4 credits (Martello, Hersey)
Please note that this course must be taken concurrently with SCI1310 (4 credits).
People, institutions, and cultures are intricately connected with the natural environment, and these connections are the source of profound scientific and historical insights. Certain combinations of values, technologies, and policies lead to a symbiotic relationship benefiting humans and the natural world. But this relationship often takes a darker turn into natural resource exploitation and environmental degradation, with the potential for catastrophic results. In this course, we will take a holistic look at anthropogenic (human‐derived) impacts on the environment, considering the historical, social, and political context surrounding environmental disasters and opportunities at local and global scales, while using chemistry, physics, and engineering to understand the fundamental physical basis of the human‐environment relationship (giving particular emphasis to aqueous‐ and gas‐phase chemical processes). Chemistry in Context is being developed and offered for the first time by Rob Martello and Scott Hersey as an eight credit course (4 SCI + 4 AHS credits) that satisfies Olin’s chemistry and materials science requirement. The pioneering students who enroll in Chemistry in Context will participate in the course design process by helping us locate readings, choose different assignments (including at least one project), and design laboratory exercises that you will then carry out. If you join us, you will not merely witness history and science… you will make it!
 
SP16:  AHSE2199A:  Narrative Psychology; 4 credits (Adler)
Humans are natural storytellers.  Indeed, it has been suggested that the natural mode of human thought takes a narrative form.  This course will present an examination of the scientific study of humans’ approach to meaning-making through the crafting and telling of personal stories.  The course will include consideration of the ways in which we create meaning out of our experiences with a special emphasis on identity development, drawing on scientific research from personality, developmental, and clinical psychology.  This course is being offered in the Psychology Department at Wellesley; it will meet on Wellesley's campus on Mondays and Thursdays from11:10am-12:20pm.  It will be primarily filled with Wellesley students, many of whom are majoring in Psychology.  Professor Adler will reserve no more than five slots for Olin students and all will be admitted only by permission of the instructor.  If you are interested in taking this course, you should email Jon (jadler@olin.edu) to let him know you are interested and determine if it will be a good fit for you.

Though a relatively new technology and art form, video gaming has become an integral part of daily life in many societies. Deeply connected to the birth of the computer and the internet, video games today shape and are shaped by our society. How have video games evolved over the past few decades? How do massive multi‐player role playing games affect how people conceptualize community? Why do certain games develop an intense cult following, while others sink into obscurity? This course will offer a broad introduction to the history of video game technology, from its inception to the present day. It will also examine major theoretical concerns involved in video gaming, such as the constructions of gender, identity, and community.
 
SP16:  AHSE2199D:  The Intersection of Art, Biology and Technology; 2 credits (Donis-Keller)
Please note that this course must be taken concurrently with SCI2099D (2 credits).
This project‐based course will encourage participants to cross boundaries between art, biology and technology with hands‐on projects inspired by contemporary and historical work in these fields. How might biology inform art practice and how might art inform biology? What role does technology play in advancing or setting back each field and how might art and biology inspire technological breakthroughs? What are the implications of being able to change the genome of an organism? These are just some of the questions we will pursue during this course. Students will conduct a CRISPR genome editing experiment and consider the ethical implications of such work. We will also work with visualization technologies such as the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Studio work will employ a variety of technologies old and new such as 3D printing in preparation for final student‐directed projects that are informed by biology, art and technology. The literature in the area of art and science, particularly with respect to biology has grown considerably and we will delve into a variety of written works, films and video resources, and listen first‐hand to practitioners in these areas about the challenges and rewards of interdisciplinary work in fields that most would regard as unrelated. The goal by the end of the course is to acquire an attitude that allows fluid movement from one field to the other in thinking and doing so as to garner creative strength not possible from study of each field alone.

Do you want to contribute to a paradigm shift in the education of engineering professionals? Do you want to make a positive impact on engineering education at Olin and beyond?
This two‐credit course offers a chance to learn about a new approach to values‐driven leadership development called “Giving Voice To Values” (GVV). This approach has made a dramatic impact on business education and business practice around the world, having been used in hundreds of schools and organizations, including engineering‐driven businesses. GVV has yet to be adapted for use in the engineering profession… until now.
Our class will begin by exploring the GVV framework and its applicability to engineers. We will work in teams to research the most critical leadership and values conflicts faced by engineering professionals in their careers and to understand faculty aspirations and reservations around addressing these conflicts. We will conclude with a design project that will give you the chance to develop workshops or co‐author educational materials for use in Olin courses and beyond. The course will be run by Rob Martello and Babson Professor Mary Gentile (an educational consultant and the author of Giving Voice to Values), using Olin’s experimental grading (EG) system.
 
SP16:  AHSE2199F:  What's Your Story?  Narrative with Purpose; 2 credits (Zastavker, Epstein)
Picture this: you are sitting across a desk from a person who holds your future in their hands. You are watching this gatekeeper read through your CV or essay or business proposal or design portfolio and that’s when they look up from your work, drop the easy demeanor and point blank ask you: “Everyone I have talked to today has impressive credentials just like you. What makes you special? What’s your story?” And that’s when you think to yourself: “I wish the work they were holding was already making my story clear.” Do you want your future to hinge on three minutes of improvisational thinking about who you are? We don’t! Use this class to think through and narrate your personal and professional story and ensure that when you meet your next gatekeeper your work will speak for itself. In this course students will have multiple, iterative opportunities to try various theoretical models for thinking and writing analytically about their work and life during their time at Olin, with the ultimate aim of producing a coherent suite of incisive analytical reflections that tell a compelling and original story for direct use in portfolios, applications, and interviews.

Penicillium.  Vibrio cholera.  Escherichia coli.  Cyanobacteria.  The archaea.  Microbes surround us, and impact our lives, our health, our societies, and our environment.  Research with microbes, the smallest of all living creatures, has enabled discovery and understanding of the fundamental workings of life, opens up rich historical narratives of diseases and cures, and may provide sustainable solutions to problems we face from bioremediation to bioenergy.   And best of all, microbes open the door to a thrilling new integrated course for a lucky group of students.
“Six Microbes that Changed the World” is an interdisciplinary course taught by Jean Huang and Rob Martello this fall.  We will use six influential microbes as a window into a rich study of the interactions between science and societal context.  This course will connect biological and historical knowledge through discussions, integrated assignments, presentations, and hands-on laboratory activities.  We are looking for a motivated group of students to join us in this experimental course; let’s explore the thrill of biology and history, together.
 
FA15:  Critical Reflective Writing; 4 credits (Zastavker, Epstein)
In this course students will have multiple, iterative opportunities to try various theoretical models for thinking and writing analytically about their work and life during their time at Olin, with the ultimate aim of producing a coherent suite of incisive analytical reflections that tell a compelling and original story for direct use in portfolios, applications, and interviews. Besides having the pragmatic value of opening doors for opportunities beyond Olin, learning to leverage analytical thinking and writing to perceive and share a personalized academic story gives our students an invaluable habit of mind for life-long learning: the understanding that what we do and learn has an ever-changing shape and story, and that at any given moment we can tap into that story and reflect on who we are, who we want to be, and what we hope to accomplish. This course is particularly intended for students writing a portfolio, personal narrative, or academic narrative for graduate schools, fellowships, job opportunities, or current Olin courses or program requirements. However, this course has value for any and every Olin student seeking to deepen analytical understanding of their work, processes, accomplishments, motivations, and goals—at Olin and beyond.
 
SP15:  Foundations of Psychology; 4 credits (Adler)
Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior, thought, emotion, and motivation.  Everything we do as people – from our work to our personal relationships to our sense of self – is impacted by psychological principles.  This course will introduce you to some of the most significant insights that psychologists have produced about the human condition while teaching you how to think like a psychologist.  You will have the opportunity to explore questions that you value in the way a psychologist would pursue them, via hands-on projects, data collection, and analysis.  We will discuss such significant topics as: what it means to be normal, how identity develops, how stable mental health is and what to do to improve it, the intersection of psychology and technology, the psychology of sustainability, the reasons we hold stereotypes and prejudice, sex differences between men and women, and many others.
There are no prerequisites for this course.  Having taken A.P. Psychology or psychology courses at Wellesley or Babson will give you a nice foundation for this course, but they will not be redundant with it.
 
SP15:  2199A:  Paradigms, Predictions and Joules:  A Historical and Scientific Approach to Energy and the Environment; 3 credits (Martello, Brabander)
Please note that this course must be taken concurrently with SCI2099 (3 credits).
This interdisciplinary course, featuring faculty and students from both Olin and Wellesley colleges, will focus on “grand challenges” at the interface between energy and the environment through the disciplinary lenses of the history of technology and environmental science. We will study the changing relationship between human societies and their natural environment, focusing upon the consequences of human energy use (agricultural production, power generation, and other forms of energy) at the local, regional, and global scales. By combining the tools, analytical frameworks, and skills found in the history and environmental science fields, we will build first-­‐order ""hindcast"" models that explain the observations and trends that we observe from historical case studies. By the end of the semester we will determine the key components required for assembling forecast-­‐oriented energy use models that extrapolate the impacts of present environmental technologies and practices into the future.
This course will include equal numbers of Olin and Wellesley students, and will alternate class sessions at both campuses. Students will begin the semester with a series of readings and exercises that build skills and familiarity in the broad area of environmental studies: for example, we will work with framing environmental concept maps using environmental engineering principles (e.g. control volumes, flux, residence time) and environmental science concepts (energy conservation and energy density calculations), historical research and analysis, environmental ethics, and writing/presentation exercises centered around important case studies of interactions between societies, energy technologies, and the natural environment. We will use these skills and perspectives for the remainder of the semester as we conduct two research projects related to energy use, sustainability, and environmental impacts in both ancient societies and the modern day. This course involves extensive team project work and will offer many opportunities for students to identify their own goals and shape their studies in order to achieve those goals.
 
SP15:  2199B:  Digital Documentary Storytelling; 2 credits in Session I (Vitols)

Students will put the “theory” into “practice” by creating their own short digital documentary. While no previous experience in filmmaking is required, this is NOT a technical course.
 
SP15:  2199C:  Hacktivism:  Hacking for the Greater Good; 2 credits in Session II (Vitols)
This workshop focuses on one intersection of activism and technology: hacking. Students will explore the history, ethics, and philosophy of hacking, while also working in groups to use technology for political and social change. Prerequisites include creativity and the desire to use technology to make the world a better place. While no previous experience in coding is required, this is NOT a technical course.

This project­based course is running for the second time in the Spring of 2016, following a successful first offering the Spring of 2015. The early weeks will expose students to principles and practices for transforming living rooms, community centers and cities into areas conducive to making, and situate the ways in which doing so can empower groups to redefine their relationship with information and individuals around them. The following weeks entail exploring existing tools for making interactive systems (e.g., microcontroller­powered development boards with sensing and actuation modules geared toward integrating with clothing or outdoor environments). Students will have opportunities to extend the kits based on an open­hardware design ethos, which could entail adding a ""bit"" to the library of littleBits (littlebits.cc). Students will then grapple with experience design to envision what should become possible at the intersection of new spaces and new tools. A field trip to a maker space will highlight innovative empowerment in practice. After prototyping experiences, students will contribute their curricular resources to appropriate online outlets (such as instructables.com).  See https://sites.google.com/site/olindream2015/.

SP15:  Applications of Microfluidics; 4 credits (Irimia, Storey)
Microfluidics systems can manipulate small volumes of fluids using small networks of channels, each of which are 10 to 100 microns in size. These devices offer the promise of integrating many laboratory processes onto a single chip, thereby increasing throughput and decreasing cost. Microfluidic technologies are proving to be a critical tool for research in drug development, genomics, proteomics, molecular diagnostics, and analytical chemistry. Further development of microfluidics is one key to future applications such as personalized medicine, integrated sensors for chemical and biological detection, inexpensive medical diagnostics, and massively parallel drug discovery. Just as microelectronics revolutionized computation by increasing capacity and decreasing the cost of performing calculations, microfluidics has the potential to do the same in biology and chemistry. In this course, we will cover some of the basic physics, chemistry, fluid mechanics, engineering and mathematics relevant to microfluidics. We will study existing microfluidics designs and functions. The course will be project based with students designing and building functional microfluidic devices relevant to global health projects.

Additional Information

FA16:  Complexity Science; 4 credits (Downey, Woodard)
“The study of complex systems represents a new approach to science that investigates how relationships between parts give rise to the collective behaviors of a system and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment.” [Wikipedia]
This class is about complexity science, data structures and algorithms in Python, and the philosophy of science:
Complexity science is an interdisciplinary field—at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and other disciplines such as physics and economics—that focuses on models of systems with many components, local interactions, and complex behavior. These models are often characterized by structure, rules and transitions rather than by equations.
Data structures and algorithms in Python: This class picks up where Software Design leaves off, introducing additional data structures, algorithms, language features, design patterns, and software engineering tools that are appropriate for modeling, simulating and analyzing complex systems.
Philosophy of science: The models and results in this class raise a number of questions relevant to the philosophy of science—including the nature of scientific laws, theory choice, realism and instrumentalism, holism and reductionism—which we will discuss as they arise, along with related readings.
Topics may include the structure and dynamics of complex networks; cellular automata, self-organized criticality, and generative systems; fitness landscape models of biological and technological evolution; and agent-based models of social and economic behavior.
FA16:  ENGR3599A:  Programming Languages; 4 credits (Pucella)
This course is an introduction to the theory, design, and implementation of programming languages. Topics covered may include: semantics of programming languages, types, higher-order functions and lambda calculus, objects, laziness, continuations, monads, objects, and concurrency. Class work revolves around the implementation of interpreters for a variety of small programming languages.
 
SP16:  Computer Networks; 4 credits (Morrow)
Computer networks have made fundamental global changes in how we live. ENGR 3599 is a project­oriented class whose goal is to have students understand how computer networks are built. In this course, students learn basic networking by themselves implementing a version of the Internet. In the first part of the course students use the Python programming language to implement network protocols on Raspberry pi computers. Each protocol the students implement corresponds to a layer of the standard OSI network model. The goal is to keep each layer simple and easy to understand. By implementing the layers of the OSI model, students come to understand the functions of each protocol layer and the rationale for a layered model. Students will present the final network for an audience of interested students, faculty and staff. For the second part of the course, students choose an application or area of networking that they would like to investigate and present to the class and interested faculty and staff.
 
FA15:  Visualizing Data; 4 credits (Pucella)
 Interactive data visualization sits at the intersection of graphic design and programming: the ideal visualization needs to be easy to understand and aesthetically pleasing, but also interactively navigable, permit different views of the data, and be responsive no matter the amount of data being displayed. The course will focus on the technological aspects of data visualization, from databases and data structures and algorithms to process data, to technologies for interactive visualization such as Javascript/D3.  Course work will be project-driven, based on existing available large data sets. By the end of the course, we should be able to construct visualizations such as http://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/world-cup/  or  http://ri.id.au/closethegap.
 
SP15:  Computer Networks; 4 credits (Morrow)
Computer Networks is a laboratory class in the design and implementation of … computer networks. This Spring 2015 class is the fourth iteration of an Olin educational research project originally sponsored by Juniper Networks.  The goal of this iteration is to teach computer networking as an Olin lab- and project-based class.  Students will implement computer networks on Raspberry pi B+ computers using the Python programming language.  This is a good way to discover that computer networks are more computer than network. The postal service, telegraphs and telephones were all networks.  Each had its own physical plants. Gmail, Twitter and Skype are versions of the postal service, the telegraph and the telephone. However, they are all just application programs sharing the same physical network of bridges, routers, gateways and services.   The class will first create teams of three or four which will develop their own internet.  Each team will begin from the bottom of the stack by creating their own physical layer; they will then create their own data link layer and from both of those, their own local area networks.  Teams will then work from the stop of the stack down, each creating a UDP application on the standard Python/Linux socket interface.  Finally, the teams will get together to create a common network layer and routers – an internet.  The teams will then study the actual TCP/IP stack by creating TCP applications on the standard Python/Linux socket interface.  They will then study basic network cryptography and implement simple symmetric and asymmetric cyphers in Python.  The final part of the class will be dedicated to student networking projects.
 
FA14:  Computational Signal Processing; 2 credits (Downey)
This is an introduction to digital signal processing, primarily sound and images, taking a computational approach.  We will use a new textbook, Think DSP, which I am working on now.  The current draft is at think-dsp.com.  Students will work on exercises from the book, help develop new material, and work on case studies that might be included in the published version of the book.  Some projects might involve basic circuit design and Arduino programming.  I expect that this class will serve as a good prelude to Signals and Systems.  In its current form, it is not a substitute for DSP in the ECE major requirements.

SP15:  A Mathematical Introduction to Cryptography; 4 credits (Patel)
Public key encryption systems are the cornerstone of secure electronic communication. At their heart is the notion of an asymmetric key: roughly speaking, mathematical operations that are easy to carry out, but hard to ""undo"". In this course, we'll develop some of the beautiful mathematics -- from areas such as number theory and algebra -- that underlie these methods, and see how they lead to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, the RSA cryptosystem, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and other such systems. There are no mathematical prerequisites but some experience with abstract mathematical reasoning, such as in a course on Discrete Mathematics, may be useful.

Within any large network, there are clusters that show uniform behavior; among the prime numbers, we can find arbitrarily long sequences that are evenly spaced; even chaotic dynamical systems, such as those giving rise to fractal images, are fundamentally deterministic. In this course we will survey some mathematical results that illustrate the phenomenon of ‘structure in randomness', and explore their causes and applications.

SP15:  Section A1:  Theoretical/Experimental Approach; 4 credits (Zastavker)
This class will venture to understand the nature of motion from an analytical perspective allowing you to reinforce your previous knowledge from ModSim and previously taken Mechanics courses as well as further developing your analysis competency. This class will use a mixture of more traditional pedagogy, i.e., interactive lectures and “problem set”-like homework assignments, and non-traditional physics classrooms pedagogy, i.e., discussions and group work. In addition, several other components typical of Olin culture will be also introduced into the course; specifically, student autonomy will be explored through a choice of final project, more traditional final exam, presentation, etc. as a way of both learning and formative assessment. A large team-work component will be also introduced through both the homework assignments and project, should students choose the latter. For students who choose their final deliverable to be in the form of a project, intermediate level of faculty-supported scaffolding will be provided as it will be expected that the students choosing this route are at least somewhat familiar with the self-directed environment and have intermediate level of sophistication as autonomous learners. Additionally, this course will support and allow for further development and honing of students' analytical writing skills.

People, institutions, and cultures are intricately connected with the natural environment, and these connections are the source of profound scientific and historical insights. Certain combinations of values, technologies, and policies lead to a symbiotic relationship benefiting humans and the natural world. But this relationship often takes a darker turn into natural resource exploitation and environmental degradation, with the potential for catastrophic results.

How might biology inform art practice and how might art inform biology? What role does technology play in advancing or setting back each field and how might art and biology inspire technological breakthroughs? What are the implications of being able to change the genome of an organism? These are just some of the questions we will pursue during this course. Students will conduct a CRISPR genome editing experiment and consider the ethical implications of such work. We will also work with visualization technologies such as the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Studio work will employ a variety of technologies old and new such as 3D printing in preparation for final student‐directed projects that are informed by biology, art and technology. The literature in the area of art and science, particularly with respect to biology has grown considerably and we will delve into a variety of written works, films and video resources, and listen first‐hand to practitioners in these areas about the challenges and rewards of interdisciplinary work in fields that most would regard as unrelated. The goal by the end of the course is to acquire an attitude that allows fluid movement from one field to the other in thinking and doing so as to garner creative strength not possible from study of each field alone.
 
SP15:  2099A:  Paradigms, Predictions and Joules:  A Historical and Scientific Approach to Energy and the Environment; 3 credits (Martello, Brabander)
Please note that this course must be taken concurrently with AHSE2199A (3 credits).
This interdisciplinary course, featuring faculty and students from both Olin and Wellesley colleges, will focus on “grand challenges” at the interface between energy and the environment through the disciplinary lenses of the history of technology and environmental science. We will study the changing relationship between human societies and their natural environment, focusing upon the consequences of human energy use (agricultural production, power generation, and other forms of energy) at the local, regional, and global scales. By combining the tools, analytical frameworks, and skills found in the history and environmental science fields, we will build first-­‐order ""hindcast"" models that explain the observations and trends that we observe from historical case studies. By the end of the semester we will determine the key components required for assembling forecast-­‐oriented energy use models that extrapolate the impacts of present environmental technologies and practices into the future.
This course will include equal numbers of Olin and Wellesley students, and will alternate class sessions at both campuses. Students will begin the semester with a series of readings and exercises that build skills and familiarity in the broad area of environmental studies: for example, we will work with framing environmental concept maps using environmental engineering principles (e.g. control volumes, flux, residence time) and environmental science concepts (energy conservation and energy density calculations), historical research and analysis, environmental ethics, and writing/presentation exercises centered around important case studies of interactions between societies, energy technologies, and the natural environment. We will use these skills and perspectives for the remainder of the semester as we conduct two research projects related to energy use, sustainability, and environmental impacts in both ancient societies and the modern day. This course involves extensive team project work and will offer many opportunities for students to identify their own goals and shape their studies in order to achieve those goals.",,Special Topics in Science,http://www.olin.edu/course-listing/sci2099-special-topics-science/,SCI

SCI3210,"Donis-Keller, Helen",4 SCI,"It is now understood that many, if not the majority, of human disorders, including cancers, have an underlying genetic component. In this modern age of healthcare, we are expected to choose amongst an array of therapeutic options for ourselves and for our children rather than respond to specific directives from the medical establishment. In addition, we are called upon as voting citizens to make ethical decisions, e.g. the appropriateness of stem cell cloning. Therefore, it is in the interest of each person to learn more than the fundamentals of biology and genetics in order to make educated choices. In this course we will be concerned with the traditional concepts of human genetics including pedigree analysis, linkage mapping, Mendelian, multi-locus and complex traits, and genetic testing. However, for the most part, the course will view human genetics through a molecular lens. For example, the molecular basis of pathological conditions such as Huntington's disease, hypercholesterolemia, Fragile-X and others will be examined in detail, as will gene imprinting and imprinting-related abnormalities (e.g. Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes). Comparative genomics will be applied to the study of heritable traits in humans. The structure, function, and evolution of the sex chromosomes will also receive special attention.
